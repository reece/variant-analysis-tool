Use Cases:
- Clinical geneticist or genetic counselor uses web-browser to investigate
  a variant identified by resequencing.
- Diagnostic lab provides links directly to variants for collated
  information.
- Bioinformatics support staff would like summary information on the
  command line in XML format.
- Scientific developer needs selected data associated with a specified
  variant.



Eventual output goals:
* Gene Information: Accession, locus, 
g.xx <-> c.xx -> r.xx -> p.xx
* Genomic Data: miRNA, TF binding, CpG, methylation, ChIP data, CNV, etc.
* Variant Information: dbSNP, COSMIC, LSDB info
* Protein: Isoforms, Features, Structure, SIFT, PolyPhen
* Evolution: nucleotide and amino acid homology (orthology+paralogy)
* Pathway, Function, Disease: OMIM, KEGG disease, GO, ICD-9/10, SnoMed
* Literature and Links: GeneReviews, PubMed, GeneRIF, x-refs/linkout, Trials
* Microarray data: ArrayExpress, GEO, NextBio
* Disease/Gene Expert links?

These data will be aggregated from numerous sources by the Python
modules. Within Python, the data will be available as Python dictionaries
or objects. XML and PDF views will become available eventually via HTTP
requests.


Additional features:
* subscribe (RSS and/or email) to gene and variants
* XML and PDF formatting
