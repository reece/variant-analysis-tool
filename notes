Q: How do I extract information from dbSNP by using eutils and specifying the
chromosome position interval?
A: Use the following eSearch query: "100000:200000[Base Position] AND
"1"[CHR] AND txid9606". See example.

You can also get the result using eFetch.(7/9/07)




VariantSpec should provide a way to translate among vs
Perhaps as a superclass with children for specific specs?




from vs:
c -> g -> p

g -> gi -> coords -> rel snps, browser
        -> gene -> generif, pubs, OMIM, GO
p -> AC -> strx, features, go
  -> homology
  -> polyphen, SIFT, others
