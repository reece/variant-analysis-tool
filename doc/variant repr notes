variant representation/parser

Computational and human representations of genomic variants are critical
for conveying and reasoning upon genomic observations.  The existence of
several such specifications confound comparisons between groups.  Our goal
is to develop a Python module that translates between such variants.




In addition, we should consider refactoring the code to support multiple
variant syntaxes (see below) and perhaps provide a superclass to enable
seamless specification and translation.
Variant standards and representations:
- http://www.hgvs.org/mutnomen/
  (with LRG support: http://www.lrg-sequence.org)
- http://www.emqn.org/emqn/Mutation-Nomenclature.html
- http://www.humgen.nl/mutalyzer/1.0.1/mutationcheck_help.html
- BIC: (requires membership)
- variant names (e.g., delta508, Factor V Leiden)
- dbsnp names
- cosmic names




Specific ideas:
- use SeqFeature to represent variant
esp location classes



pseudo-grammar:
<type> = [cgmr]
<spos> = 14, 88+1, 89-2, -14, *46
<posr> = <spos>_<spos>
subst
del
dup
delins
inv
