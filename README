Genome Commons Variant Annotation Tool
Reece Hart <reece@berkeley.edu>

The Genome Commons Variant Analysis Tool facilitates the investigation of
genomic variants.  The input is a single variant using standard HGVS
nomenclature, and the output is a web page with publicly available
information relevant to inferring possible impacts of the variant.  Data
are provided from source databases directly and are therefore always
up-to-date.
